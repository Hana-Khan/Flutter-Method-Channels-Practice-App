# Method-channels-Practice-Application (Bridging Between Dart and Native Code with Flutter Method Channel for Communication with Each Other)


A Flutter project for identifying battery level of a device. In this app I have used method channels for bridging Dart and Platform Specific Code


## Getting Started

Learn how to communicate between Flutter and Native code. Itâ€™s something like you make a bridge from your Flutter code and then it will connect to the other side in Native code. The fact is Flutter allow us to communicate from Dart code to Kotlin/Java in Android and Objective C/Swift in iOS.


For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
